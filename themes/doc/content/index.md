Build tools deserve the same attention as the software. There is a bunch of processes related to coding that are hidden, make them visible. Processes and knowledge degrade on their own, expend energy to maintain them. When designing user/developer facing software make right things obvious, wrong things impossible to perform. You spend a lot of time inside an IDE, memorize key commands. Resources are finite, take that into consideration when planning projects. Learn to estimate, it's an important part of decision making.
