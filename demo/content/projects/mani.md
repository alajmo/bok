mani is a tool that helps you manage multiple repositories. It's helpful when you are working with microservices or multi-project system and libraries and want a central place for pulling all repositories and running commands over the different projects. You specify projects and commands in a yaml config and then run the commands over all or a subset of the projects. [Check it out](https://github.com/samiralajmovic/mani).
