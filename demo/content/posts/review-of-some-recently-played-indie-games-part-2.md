title: Review of Some Recently Played Indie Games, Part Two
---

Continuing the series I have a new batch of playworthy indie games! To make it more scientifical, the framework for game review will be the following:

- sound
- video
- gameplay
- story
- bugs
- movement
- immersion
- ties together

## Table of Contents

## Subnautica

> Lala

## Dusk

> Lala

Brings back old memory
Good incentive to continue on the story
Some shaky UI controls for loading/saving games
Great mechanics

## Blasphemous

Good arcade
Engaging system
special abilities, meh
Great story and lore, hard to follow though

## Beat

> Lala

## Celeste

- Great story, keeps you drawn in
- Great pixel art
- Awesome controls, tight as hell, forgiving
- Perfect amount of features
- Good intro

## The Way

- Good story line
- Emotional
- Difficult enough puzzles, some require paper and pen
- Beautiful pixel graphics
- Perfect game length

## Rime

+ Good story line
- Somehow gets easier as u get closer to the end
- Not too difficult puzzles
- PC controllers are a bit wibbly
