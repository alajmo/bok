title: Software and Tools I Use
---

It's been a while since I last updated the toolset and softwarea that I use for development. I briefly [mentioned](/posts/an-overview-of-the-ecosystem-of-web-development-tools/) using Sublime in a post but times have changed since then.

So, here follows a list of software, tools and frameworks I use in my day to day work with programming and computers in general.

* Vim
* Mmux
* Bash
* Git
* Docker
* Ansible
* Github
* Node.js
* Nginx
* Npm
* Webpack / Gulp
* Chrome
* PostgreSQL
* SQLite
* Google Analytics

You can also take a look at my dotfiles if that interests you at [github](https://github.com/samiralajmovic/dotfiles).
